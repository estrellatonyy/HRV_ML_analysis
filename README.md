# Identification of athleticism and sports profiles throughout machine learning applied to heart rate variability

Replication code of the paper which focuses on checkin and applying Machine Learnign algorithm (Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine) in heart rate variability parameters obtained from athletes and non-athletes according to a same strict methodology. 
The specific objectives are: a) to obtain an athleticism index for identifying people with athletic characteristics; b) to identify individual sports profiles for differentiating or recognizing an athlete from the set of athletes who practice the same sport.
