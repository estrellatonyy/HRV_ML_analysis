# Replication code for "Identification of athleticism and sports profiles throughout machine learning applied to heart rate variability"

This repository contains the replication code in R for the paper title, "Identification of athleticism and sports profiles throughout machine learning applied to heart rate variability". This work investigates the application of Machine Learnign algorithm (Random Forest, XGBoost, Support Vector Machine) on heart rate variability (HRV) data collectes from athletes and non-athletes.

## Specific Objectives:
The specific objectives are: 
- to develop an **athleticism index** to identify individuals with athletic characteristics, based on their HRV;
- to identify individual **sports profiles** for differentiating or recognizing an athlete from the set of athletes who practice the same sport.

## Requierments
This code is built in R, and you will need the following packages: 
- readxl
- tidyverse
- tidymodels
- compareGroups
- themis
- DALEXtra
- agua
- h2o
- patchwork
- gtsummary
